# Classifying PubMed RCT abstracts.
A project using tensorflow to perform text classification using approaches in the paper in this repo, along with some of my own modifications.

This project is based on NLP, particularly sequential sentence classification as belonging to the #BACKGROUND, #CONCLUSION, #RESULT and other such sections 
of the papers in PubMEd RCT dataset. Classifying sentences in the abstracts can make them more organized and easy to read.
